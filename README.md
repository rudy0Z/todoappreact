- 🔄 Toggle task completion status  
- 🔤 Sort tasks A–Z or Z–A  
- 🔍 Filter by: All, Active, Completed  
- ✏️ Update task status (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Completed`)

## 📦 Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudy0Z/react-todo-app.git
cd react-todo-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

 Testing Guidance
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173

Add a task → Make sure it appears in the list

Toggle its checkbox → It should strike through

Change its status from the dropdown

Try sorting, filtering (Active, Completed)

Reload the page → Tasks should still be there (check localStorage)
